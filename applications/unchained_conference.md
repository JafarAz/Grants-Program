## Project Overview 

### Overview

Composable is working to host Unchained v2, the follow-up to our inaugural conference supporting the seamless chain-agnostic future of DeFi.

In its v2, Unchained will continue to work to unite different blockchain ecosystems and their projects and users, while incorporating the newest innovations in the space such as intent-centricity. At Unchained v2, we hope to bring together teams and thought leaders in Polkadot/Kusama, Cosmos, Ethereum Solana, and more as we discuss topics that are relevant to all, such as shared security, L1/L2s versus the parachain model, and more - with a particular focus on interoperability and how we can all collaborate to bring DeFi to mainstream use.

We believe that this conference will serve the DotSama ecosystem by connecting Polkadot projects and participants with other networks. Thus, this will promote collaborations and partnerships amongst Polkadot teams and teams in other major ecosystems (Cosmos, Ethereum, and Solana). These inter-ecosystem collaborations can be made possible by Composable’s various cross-chain infrastructures. 

Composable believes it is a great time to host Unchained v2, as in the few years since the first Unchained, it has become increasingly clear that the future of DeFi is cross-chain. While cross-chain interoperability is not a new idea, we now have many of the tools and technologies to make it a reality, in addition to community-wide buy-in to this concept. With a crypto bull run apparently underway, now is the time for various ecosystems to unite in our efforts to bring DeFi to maximum utility and thus mass adoption.

### Project Details   

**What:**

Composable’s Unchained v2 will be a conference supporting collaboration and exploration in seamless chain-agnostic experiences. Specifically, we aim to drive conversation and innovation around cross-domain intents, where users specify what they want to achieve in a given transaction but not necessarily how they want to achieve it. To do so, we will bring together the greatest minds in DeFi, from the Cosmos, Ethereum, Solana, and of course DotSama, for presentations, workshops, discussion panels, brainstorming sessions, and hackathons. We hope for this conference to result in a number of cross-chain collaborations, inspiration for new projects and solutions, and ongoing open conversations between different ecosystems.

These collaborations can be powered by the infrastructure that Composable is building. This includes:

- Composable’s IBC-enabled, trust-minimized bridge, [trustless.zone](https://www.trustless.zone/)
- [The Composable Virtual Machine (CVM)](https://docs.composable.finance/technology/cvm/#summary), the language and execution runtime for cross-chain program execution and intents settlement
- [Multichain Agnostic Normalised Trust-minimised Intent Settlement (MANTIS)](https://docs.composable.finance/technology/mantis/), an ecosystem-agnostic intent settlement framework

**When/Where:**

We plan to host this event around the time of the [ETHBerlin Conference](https://ethberlin.org/), which is May 24 to 26, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. This conference is hosted by the [Department of Decentralization] (https://dod.ngo/), who describe themselves as “a collective of people from various crypto, decentralization and peer-to-peer communities in and around Berlin”. This group organized the first EthBerlin in 2018 and has organized a dozen events and conferences since then, with significant popularity; the 3rd and most recent ETHBerlin in 2022 drew 1,000 attendees. 

We chose to schedule around this conference not only because of the large crowd that it draws, but also because of the diversity of its participants. Ethereum is the original home and still the largest hub of DeFi, and thus many users and participants in other ecosystems also have interest and participation in Ethereum. 

**Why**

T3rn does a great job of summarizing the current growth, advantages, and challenges facing cross-chain DeFi in their article [here](https://www.t3rn.io/blog/cross-chain-defi). To summarize, cross-chain interoperability in the DeFi space delivers superior liquidity, broader user bases, minimized dependency, and enhanced versatility for users. Yet, despite these benefits, cross-chain DeFi is still held back by scaling hurdles, security concerns, and lack of true and seamless interoperability.

At Composable, we believe that it is important to overcome these challenges and deliver a truly interoperable DeFi experience to users. If we are able to do this, then DeFi will be maximally user-friendly, effective, and efficient, optimally positioning it for mass adoption. However, to achieve interoperability, different ecosystems must collaborate, synergizing to create a chain-agnostic DeFi landscape that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Therefore, with Unchained v2, Composable hopes to bring together leaders and participants across different ecosystems under one roof, where we can work together to execute upon our shared vision.

**How**

Composable hopes to host Unchained v2 through grant support by the Web3 Foundation. The Web3 Foundation could be a co-host with Composable, with Composable carrying out all duties related to logistics, planning, etc.

Specifically, Unchained V2 will be planned as a side event around [EthBerlin](https://ethberlin.org/), which is planned for May 24-26, 2024, in Berlin, Germany. The EthBerlin event will bring many thought leaders and participants from many blockchain ecosystems including Polkadot to Berlin at this time. Thus, timing Unchained V2 as a side event to EthBerlin will capitalize upon their presence in the area.

Unchained V2 will be a conference event where we host a series of talks and panels, a hackathon, and more. We are particularly excited to provide an opportunity to parachain teams to debate and showcase Polkadot technology to participants from all ecosystems in DeFi. Thus, the conference will put particular emphasis on exploring areas of convergence and collaboration between Polkadot and teams building in other ecosystems.

### Ecosystem Fit

At Composable, we are early believers in and adopters of DotSama. Composable itself got its start in DotSama; we have both a Kusama parachain, [Picasso](https://picasso.xyz/), as well as a Polkadot parachain, [Composable](https://docs.composable.finance/networks/composable-parachain-overview). We have since expanded to other ecosystems, including our [Composable Cosmos](https://docs.composable.finance/networks/composable-cosmos) chain. Our parachains are critical pieces of our cross-chain infrastructure, and due to their DotSama basis, provide high security, efficiency, and native interoperability.

We remain firm believers in the manifold benefits of DotSama, and actively work to support awareness and adoption of this ecosystem. For example, we applied for and were awarded with funding from Polkadot to be sponsors at the Cosmoverse 2023 conference and serve as ambassadors for DotSama, along with a few other parachain team representatives.

Now, Unchained v2 represents an even greater opportunity for us to promote DotSama to other ecosystem participants; there are no other conferences that are focused on cross-chain interoperability. Moreover, through our own conference, we are able to hand-pick the projects and participants (including ecosystems, protocols, developers, thought leaders, and users) who are innovating in the interoperability and intents spaces. Thus, we can create the optimal environment to help DotSama and other ecosystems form productive collaborations geared towards best serving users.
